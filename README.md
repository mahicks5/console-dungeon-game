# Assignment 5: Design Patterns
**Maxwell Hicks (mahicks5)**

>  The design patterns I implemented in this project were Factory, 
> Strategy, and Singleton. All of these design patterns work in tandem to help create my game what it is.
> The Strategy pattern is what I used to apply stat upgrades in an easier manner.
> The Factory pattern was used in a handful of places to handle creating weapons, armor, names, and other things.
> This was a good choice because it made creating things easier and less startup to making them.
> The Singleton pattern was used in multiple places to ensure only management classes and the
> dice class was only created once. This allowed me to ensure only one type of management device was active.
